                PROFILE<br><br>
                My past work experience has taught me how to think on your feet, adapt , and never waste an opportunity to learn.<br><br>
                WORK EXPERIENCE<br>
                Manager, Cloud 9,  Athens, Ga — 8/17 - 10/18<br>
                After moving back to Athens and wanting a change a pace, I went to work for my friend managing the largest retail store in downtown Athens. The store went from $30-40k gross sales/month to $70-90k during my time there.<br><br>
                Package Tech/Supervisor,  Fed-Ex, Athens/Columbus, Ga — 12/15 - 8/17<br>
                After having to move to Athens, and there being no UPS close by, I went to Fed-Ex. Similar job but with more responsibilities. I transferred to Columbus for 6 months as well for a pay raise.<br><br>
                Package Tech, UPS, Roswell, Ga — 10/15 - 12/15<br>
                A typical day would start at 3:45AM and involve loading and organizing 3-4 UPS trucks with up to 400 packages a piece until 9:00AM.<br><br>
                Server, Village Tavern, Alpharetta, Ga — 1/15 - 10-15<br>
                This was a busy but upscale restaurant and working here instilled time management, and staying cool under pressure.<br><br>
                Demolition worker, Lanier Construction & Demo, Cumming, Ga — 6/13 - 8/13<br>
                Removed all the vinyl flooring from 3 schools. Hard work, but a good first job.<br><br>
                EDUCATION<br>
                Berry College, Rome, Ga - I studied philosophy and international relations and played baseball for three semesters.<br><br>									                        
                Courses<br>
                Georgia Tech’s 6 month full stack web development bootcamp
